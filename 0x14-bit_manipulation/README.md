# 0x14.C-Bit manipulation

## Learning Objectives

### General
* How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators

## Requirements


### General
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etcâ€¦ is forbidden
* You are allowed to use putchar
* In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions.
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function putchar should be included in your header file called holberton.h
* Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded


## Tasks

### Mandatory
